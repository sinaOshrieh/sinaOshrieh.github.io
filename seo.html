    <h1>SEO Techniques</h1>
    
    <section>
        <p>
            One effective SEO technique is the use of meta descriptions. These short summaries of web page content appear in search engine results, helping users decide if a page matches their query. Including relevant keywords in the meta description can improve visibility and click-through rates (Moz, 2024). This technique is simple yet impactful in improving organic traffic.
        </p>
        <b>The strategy above is the strategy we've used in this lab.</b>
        <p>
            Another SEO strategy is optimizing page load speed. Faster-loading websites rank higher in search results, as speed contributes to a better user experience. Reducing image sizes and enabling browser caching are common methods to achieve this (Google Developers, 2024). This technique ensures users stay engaged, reducing bounce rates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Structured data markup is also an effective SEO technique. It helps search engines understand page content and can generate rich snippets, such as star ratings or recipe instructions, in search results. This visibility enhancement often leads to higher click-through rates (Search Engine Journal, 2024).

    <h1>SMO Techniques</h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Social Media Optimization (SMO) can involve integrating a "Facebook Like" button on websites. This feature encourages users to share content directly on their profiles, increasing visibility and traffic from Facebook (Smith, 2024). It also helps in building a larger audience for the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instagram marketing is another powerful SMO technique. By linking to Instagram pages, businesses can showcase visual content that resonates with users. This drives engagement, especially for brands targeting younger demographics (Brown, 2024).
        </p>
        <p>
            Adding social sharing buttons across a website is a broad SMO strategy. It allows users to effortlessly share content on platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn, amplifying the website's reach (Miller, 2024). This practice can enhance the overall social footprint and foster user engagement.
